#write a program to print a number of options, and allow the user to select an option from
#the list. There must be more than 4 options and less than 9. 

#The program should continue looping, allowing the user to choose one of the options each 
#time round.

#The loop should only terminate when the user chooses 0.

#If the user makes a valid choice, the program should print a short message.
#The message should include the value that they typed
#Don't print a different message for each choice - the only thing that should change is the 
#number they typed.  

#If their choice isn't one in the list of options nothing should be printed (although you
#should see there input on the screen)

#As optional extra, modify the program so the menu is printed again if they choose an 
#invalid option. Do this without duplicating the print lines
